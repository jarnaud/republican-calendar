### Non-historical period

The Republican calendar was used historically between 1791 and 1805.
However, we can use this calendar for other dates, based on following rules:

- Dates before 1792-22-01 are not defined.
- Dates after 1806-01-01 (end of Republican calendar) are estimated based on the commonly used Romme method.

### Online converters

NB: a lot of online converters are incorrect for dates outside the period of real historical
usage of the Republican calendar, use with care.
